# Changelog

## v0.3.1

This is a minor release for opBNB Mainnet and Testnet.

In this release, we've introduced significant optimizations and enhancements across various modes and functionalities, including PBSS Mode optimizations, the introduction of Fast Node Mode, EVM execution improvements, and a simplified start command, aimed at enhancing performance and user experience.

Upgrading is optional.

### User Facing Changes

- **PBSS Mode Optimizations**: We have made multiple optimizations for PBSS mode, including the implementation of an async buffer, support for obtaining withdrawal proof on PBSS, and the introduction of an HBSS to PBSS convert tool. For more details, please refer to #69, #74, and #79.
- **Fast Node Mode**: We have introduced a new mode called "Fast Node" to improve the performance and reduce the resources required by the node. This enhancement is aimed at providing a more efficient and streamlined experience. Please see more details in #75.
- **EVM Execution Opcode Level Optimization**: Our latest update includes optimizations at the EVM execution opcode level, resulting in improved performance for EVM execution. For a deeper understanding of these changes, please refer to #77 and #81.
- **Simplified Start Command**: We have simplified the start command by enabling the selection of default network configuration through the use of `--opBNBMainnet` or `--opBNBTestnet` in the command. This enhancement aims to streamline the user experience. More information can be found in #91.

## v0.3.0

This is a recommended release for op-geth. This release brings in upstream updates, see https://github.com/bnb-chain/op-geth/pull/58 for the contents. This is also a ready release for the next planed fork, which will bring in canyon fork from upstream as well.

### User Facing Changes

- Feature of config tries layer number in memory is removed, and related flag `--triesInMemory` is deleted.
- If start a fresh node, will use pebble db as default(set `--db.engine=leveldb` if prefer leveldb)
- You can start opbnb mainnet or testnet without init genesis.json, and use flag `--opBNBMainnet` or `--opBNBTestnet` to start new node. If you have already inited genesis.json, you can still use these two flags, which will check whether the content of your init is correct.

### Full Changelog

https://github.com/bnb-chain/op-geth/compare/v0.2.2...v0.3.0

## v0.2.2

This is a minor release for opBNB Mainnet and Testnet.
It primarily optimizes op-geth and introduces an option to re-announce remote transactions.
Upgrading is optional.

### User Facing Changes

- The startup node will default to using the bootnodes of the opBNB mainnet. If the `--networkid=` is configured as testnet, the testnet bootnodes will be used. If `--bootnodes=` is configured, the specified bootnodes will be used. The configured `--bootnodes=` take precedence over other options.[#32](https://github.com/bnb-chain/op-geth/pull/32)
- Enable re-announce remote transactions by using the flag `--txpool.reannounceremotes=true`.[#33](https://github.com/bnb-chain/op-geth/pull/33)

## v0.2.0

This is a hardfork release for the opBNB Testnet called Fermat.
It will be activated at block height 12113000, expected to occur on November 3, 2023, at 6 AM UTC.

### User Facing Changes

- Two new precompiled contracts have been introduced: blsSignatureVerify and cometBFTLightBlockValidate. The purpose of blsSignatureVerify is to verify BLS signatures in smart contracts, while cometBFTLightBlockValidate is designed to validate cometBFT light blocks. Although these contracts were primarily introduced to facilitate cross-chain communication between opBNB and Greenfield, they can also be utilized for other purposes. For instance, blsSignatureVerify can be employed to verify BLS signatures in smart contracts, and cometBFTLightBlockValidate can facilitate cross-chain communication with other blockchains based on the cosmos framework.(#7)
- Enable the layer 2 sync mechanism for opBNB by using the flag `--syncmode=snap` or `--syncmode=full` to choose the sync mode. Make sure to enable the `l2.engine-sync=true` flag on the op-node. (#8)

### Partial Changelog

- #7: feat: add precompiled contracts for Greenfield link
- #8: feat: support snap sync for OP chains
- #11: fix: pass a SnapshotOption func when init a new pruner
- #24: snap: fix snap-tests to handle legacy code lookups 
- #25: sec: update version of cometbft
